# Pronto::Punchlist

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apiology/pronto-punchlist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apiology/pronto-punchlist)

Performs incremental quality reporting for the punchlist gem.
Punchlist reports on any 'TOD O'-style comments in code; this gem plugs
in with the 'pronto' gem, which does incremental reporting using a
variety of quality tools.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pronto-punchlist'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install pronto-punchlist
```

## Usage

This is typically used either as part a custom
[pronto](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto) rigging, sometimes as
part of general use of the
[quality](https://github.com/apiology/quality) gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt
that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will
create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push
the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
